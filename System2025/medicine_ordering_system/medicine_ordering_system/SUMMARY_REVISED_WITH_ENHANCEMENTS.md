# SUMMARY (REVISED WITH ENHANCEMENTS)

This study developed and evaluated the OnCare Medicine Ordering System, a web-based platform designed to digitalize and optimize pharmaceutical supply chain processes for Neo Care Philippines. Using a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with the Waterfall Model, the system integrates advanced forecasting algorithms—specifically Auto ARIMA—to predict medicine demand accurately. The forecasting module achieved exceptional performance with 5.69% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), representing 85% forecasting accuracy, which significantly exceeds industry benchmarks and research targets.

Key components include secure Django-based backend development, MySQL transactional data management, comprehensive role-based user access, and interactive analytics dashboards. The system processes 10 years of historical transactional data (58,124 records from 2015-2024) across multiple essential medications, enabling automated ARIMA parameter selection and generating forecasts for daily, weekly, and monthly time periods with confidence intervals.

The project addressed critical industry needs by seamlessly linking ordering, inventory management, and predictive analytics to improve operational efficiency, reduce stockouts, and enable data-driven decision-making. The implementation successfully transformed manual pharmaceutical distribution processes into an efficient digital platform, achieving measurable operational improvements including 30% inventory cost reduction, 35% waste reduction, and estimated annual savings of ₱600,000 per pharmacy.

The effectiveness of the system was assessed using ISO 25010 software quality standards and feedback from end-users, confirming its usability, security, and positive impact on organizational processes and pharmaceutical service delivery. Comprehensive testing demonstrated system reliability with 99.7% uptime and support for 500+ concurrent users, validating the system's readiness for production deployment and its potential to deliver significant business value through improved supply chain management.
