## SPECIFIC WRITING IMPROVEMENTS

### Academic Tone Enhancements

**Current Style Issues:**
- Some informal language
- Missing hedging language
- Insufficient use of passive voice where appropriate
- Limited use of academic connectors

**Examples of Improvements:**

**Before:**
"The system helps managers make better decisions."

**After:**
"The system facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling managers to make informed strategic decisions based on predictive analytics and real-time performance metrics."

**Before:**
"We developed a web-based system."

**After:**
"A web-based ordering system was developed and implemented to address the inventory management challenges identified in the problem statement."

### Sentence Structure Improvements

**Current:**
"The system uses Django. It has ARIMA forecasting. Managers can see forecasts."

**Improved:**
"The system, developed using the Django framework, integrates Auto-ARIMA forecasting capabilities that enable managers to access demand predictions through interactive dashboards, thereby supporting strategic inventory planning and decision-making processes."

### Citation Integration

**Current:**
"ARIMA is good for forecasting."

**Improved:**
"ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models have been widely recognized as effective tools for time series forecasting (Box & Jenkins, 2015), with recent applications demonstrating their utility in supply chain demand prediction (Author, 2023; Author, 2024)."
