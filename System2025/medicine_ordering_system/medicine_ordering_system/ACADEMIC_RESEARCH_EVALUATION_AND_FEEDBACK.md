**C. Software Development Tools**

The following software tools and technologies were used throughout the development of the ON-CARE system:

**Backend Programming Languages**

**Python 3.13.** Python was chosen as the primary programming language for ON-CARE because it offers the best balance of simplicity and powerful capabilities needed for this type of system. Unlike other languages that can be complex and hard to read, Python's straightforward syntax means developers can write code faster and fix issues more easily, which is crucial when building a system that needs to be reliable and maintainable for a pharmaceutical business. 

What makes Python particularly valuable for ON-CARE is its rich collection of specialized libraries that are perfectly suited for the system's needs. For the forecasting features, Python provides PMDARIMA and Statsmodels—libraries specifically built for time series analysis and ARIMA modeling. For building the web application, Django offers a robust framework that handles security and database management. For processing and analyzing the large amounts of sales data, Pandas and NumPy provide efficient tools that can handle thousands of transaction records quickly. 

The real advantage is that all these tools work seamlessly together within the same language, so the system can process sales data, run forecasting models, manage user accounts, and serve web pages all using Python. This eliminates the need to switch between different programming languages or deal with complex integrations, making the entire system more cohesive and easier to maintain. Version 3.13 was specifically selected because it includes performance improvements that make forecasting calculations faster, and enhanced security features that are essential when handling sensitive pharmaceutical and customer data.

**Web Framework and API Development**

**Django 5.2.6.** Django was chosen as the web framework for ON-CARE because it provides everything needed to build a secure, professional web application quickly and efficiently. Instead of building security features from scratch, Django comes with built-in protections against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, which is critical when handling sensitive pharmaceutical and prescription data. 

The framework's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture organizes code in a clear, logical structure that makes it easy to build and maintain different features—whether it's the medicine ordering system, inventory management, or analytics dashboards. Django also includes a ready-made admin interface that allows system administrators to manage medicines, orders, and users without needing to write custom code, saving significant development time.

Perhaps most importantly, Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplifies database work by letting developers interact with the database using Python code instead of writing complex SQL queries. This makes it straightforward to manage medicine catalogs, process orders, track inventory, and handle user accounts, while Django automatically ensures data stays consistent and secure. For a system like ON-CARE that needs to be reliable and maintainable, Django's "batteries included" approach means less custom code to write and fewer potential security issues to worry about.

**Django REST Framework 3.16.1.** Django REST Framework (DRF) was used to build the API that connects different parts of ON-CARE together. While Django handles the web pages, DRF creates the API endpoints that enable real-time features like checking inventory availability, processing orders, accessing forecast data, and generating analytics reports.

The main reason DRF was chosen is that it provides ready-made tools for the most common API needs—authentication, permissions, and data formatting—which means developers don't have to build these from scratch. This saves significant development time and ensures the API is secure and well-structured. DRF's token-based authentication ensures that only authorized users (sales representatives, pharmacists, and administrators) can access sensitive pharmaceutical data through the API.

Additionally, DRF seamlessly connects the web interface with the ARIMA forecasting engine, allowing the system to generate forecasts in the background and update analytics dashboards in real-time without requiring page refreshes. The framework's browsable API feature also makes it easy to test and document the API during development, which helps ensure everything works correctly before deployment.

**Database Management**

**MySQL (with mysqlclient 2.2.7).** MySQL was selected as the database system because it's reliable, secure, and capable of handling large amounts of data efficiently. It stores all the critical information for ON-CARE, including medicine catalogs, order transactions, user accounts, inventory records, forecasting results, and system logs. MySQL's ACID compliance ensures that data remains consistent and accurate, which is crucial for pharmaceutical inventory management and financial transactions where errors could have serious consequences. The mysqlclient library provides a smooth connection between Python and MySQL, enabling efficient database operations even when processing large volumes of transactional data (over 58,000 records) and handling real-time inventory updates. MySQL's security features, including data encryption, protect sensitive pharmaceutical data, customer information, and prescription records from unauthorized access, helping ensure compliance with healthcare data protection regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**

**Pandas 2.3.2.** Pandas is used in ON-CARE because it makes it easy to work with and analyze large datasets, especially time series data like historical sales records. It processes historical transactional sales data, identifies medicine demand patterns, analyzes order trends, and prepares forecasting results. Pandas' efficient data structures and built-in methods allow the system to quickly transform and analyze data, which is essential for preparing time series data for ARIMA modeling, analyzing demand trends, and generating comprehensive reports. The library's DataFrame functionality makes it simple to organize transactional data by medicine, time period, and sales representative, which enables accurate demand forecasting and helps optimize supply chain decisions.

**NumPy 2.3.2.** NumPy provides the mathematical foundation for all the numerical calculations in ON-CARE, especially for ARIMA forecasting. It handles large arrays of numbers efficiently and provides fast mathematical operations that are essential for forecasting calculations, statistical analysis, and processing time series data. NumPy's optimized performance ensures that the system can quickly perform ARIMA parameter optimization, calculate forecast accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE), and evaluate statistical models (AIC, BIC), even when working with large historical datasets spanning 10 years of transaction data. Without NumPy, these calculations would be too slow for real-time forecasting.

**Matplotlib 3.10.6.** Matplotlib creates the charts and graphs that visualize demand forecasting trends, inventory analytics, sales performance metrics, and ARIMA model diagnostics in ON-CARE. It generates publication-quality visualizations that support system reporting and analysis, including time series plots showing how sales change over time, comparisons between forecasted and actual demand, seasonal pattern charts, and model evaluation graphs. These visualizations are essential for helping managers understand forecasting results and make informed inventory planning decisions.

**Seaborn 0.13.2.** Seaborn simplifies the creation of complex statistical visualizations that help analyze system performance and identify demand patterns. It creates visualizations like demand distribution plots, seasonal pattern analysis charts, correlation matrices showing relationships between different medicine sales, and regression plots for assessing forecasting accuracy. These visualizations help users understand relationships between different medicines and market factors that influence pharmaceutical sales, making it easier to spot trends and make data-driven decisions.

**Plotly 6.3.0.** Plotly creates interactive web-based visualizations that can be embedded directly in the ON-CARE web application. It enables the creation of dynamic charts and dashboards for real-time demand forecasting analytics, inventory level monitoring, order trend visualization, and ARIMA model performance tracking. Plotly's interactive features enhance the user experience by allowing managers and administrators to explore forecast data through zooming, panning, and filtering, enabling them to interactively explore demand trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasting accuracy across different medicine categories and time periods.

**Scikit-learn 1.7.1.** Scikit-learn provides machine learning tools that support data preprocessing for ARIMA forecasting, detect anomalies in demand patterns, and enable predictive analytics for inventory optimization. While ARIMA is the primary forecasting method in ON-CARE, scikit-learn provides complementary tools for data scaling, feature engineering, and model validation that enhance the overall forecasting pipeline. These tools also support potential future enhancements with additional machine learning approaches.

**Statsmodels 0.14.5.** Statsmodels provides advanced statistical analysis tools that are essential for ARIMA forecasting in ON-CARE. It supports stationarity testing (to check if data patterns are consistent over time), autocorrelation analysis (to identify patterns in the data), seasonal decomposition (to separate trends from seasonal effects), and residual diagnostics (to validate that the forecasting model is working correctly). The library provides comprehensive tools for time series analysis, model diagnostics, and statistical validation of forecasting models, ensuring that the demand predictions used for pharmaceutical inventory management are robust and reliable.

**PMDARIMA (Auto ARIMA).** PMDARIMA automates the complex process of building ARIMA forecasting models, which would otherwise require extensive statistical expertise and manual parameter tuning. It automatically selects the optimal ARIMA model parameters and seasonal components by systematically testing different combinations, eliminating the need for manual configuration. The library automatically handles stationarity testing, differencing (to remove trends from data), and model selection based on AIC and BIC criteria, making it possible for ON-CARE to generate accurate forecasts without requiring users to have deep statistical knowledge.

**Front-end Technologies**

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language).** HTML provides the structural foundation for all web pages in ON-CARE, defining how content is organized and displayed. It creates the layout for medicine ordering pages, inventory management interfaces, analytics dashboards, and user administration screens. HTML5 features, including semantic elements and form validation, enhance the user experience and support modern web application requirements, enabling intuitive interfaces for sales representatives to create orders, pharmacists to manage inventory, and administrators to access forecasting analytics.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).** CSS controls how the ON-CARE interface looks and feels, creating visually appealing and professional-looking dashboards, forms, and interactive elements. It ensures that the system looks good and works well across different devices and screen sizes, from desktop computers to tablets and smartphones. CSS3 features, including flexbox and grid layouts, ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility, so users have a consistent experience regardless of what device or browser they're using.

**JavaScript.** JavaScript makes the ON-CARE interface interactive and dynamic, enabling real-time features that enhance user experience. It provides real-time form validation when creating orders, loads inventory updates without refreshing the page, and creates interactive features like dynamic chart updates for forecasting dashboards, real-time stock availability checking, and dynamic content updates for order status tracking. JavaScript's event handling and DOM manipulation capabilities make the medicine ordering process smooth and seamless, from managing the shopping cart to submitting orders and tracking their status.

**Development and Deployment Tools**

**Git Version Control.** Git tracks all changes made to the source code throughout the development process, making it easy to manage collaborative development and maintain code quality. It enables version control of the entire codebase, supporting team collaboration through branching and merging strategies, and ensuring that code changes can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back if needed.

**Virtual Environment (venv).** Python's built-in virtual environment tool isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different Python packages used in ON-CARE and other projects. It ensures consistent development and deployment environments, supporting reproducible builds and preventing dependency-related issues during system deployment. This means the system will work the same way in development, testing, and production environments.

**Package Management (pip).** pip serves as the standard package manager for Python, making it easy to install and manage all the required libraries and dependencies for ON-CARE. It ensures proper dependency resolution and version management, supporting reliable system deployment and maintenance. This means all developers and deployment environments use the same versions of libraries, preventing compatibility issues.
